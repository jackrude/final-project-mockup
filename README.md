# final-project-mockup

## Overview

For my final mockup I have chosen the Campus Jam project.  I wanted the design to be simple and easy to use, with little 
ovehead.  Overall it looks allright, but if I had more time it would look even better.

##Issues

A few problems I have come accross are as follows.  First off I have run out of different page ideas.  The description for this
final project was a bit ambiguous and vague. I came up with a edit profile page, and view other profiles page, and also 
a login page.  But there does not seem to be many more things I can add at the moment that would better fit the criteria so
far.  Another issue is for a homepage, there needs to be a purpose.  In the description for this assignment I did not see anything
as far as requirements for a homepage. If I personally had more time to spend on this, my mockup would look a lot better.
Anyways, here are some screenshots of the mockup.  Definitely has potential to grow in my humble opinion!

Homepage

This is the homepage, very simple.  I modeled it similar to the digits practice wod.  I need something to go in the body
to fill it in better and make the page flow better.


Login Page

This is the login page.  It will automatically redirect the user to the login screen for the university portal.  If
the page does not automatically redirect the user, clicking the button will do so.  This page will not be in the menu
bar after logging in.


Edit Profile page

This page contains the user's profile information.  It will show all of the users details and will give them access to
edit it.  Only when a user is logged in can they edit their own profile.  Admin's will have access to the profiles as well
for more complete control


View Profile Page
<img width="1440" alt="screen shot 2017-03-20 at 9 04 14 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22675838/24136020/f5810974-0db0-11e7-905c-9e4f74539990.png">
The view profile page will have a list of all the user's in the database.  Eventually a search bar will be implemented making
quicker searches for potential band mates much more easy.
