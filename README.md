# final-project-mockup

## Overview

For my final mockup I have chosen the Campus Jam project.  I wanted the design to be simple and easy to use, with little 
ovehead.  Overall it looks allright, but if I had more time it would look even better.

##Issues

A few problems I have come accross are as follows.  First off I have run out of different page ideas.  The description for this
final project was a bit ambiguous and vague. I came up with a edit profile page, and view other profiles page, and also 
a login page.  But there does not seem to be many more things I can add at the moment that would better fit the criteria so
far.  Another issue is for a homepage, there needs to be a purpose.  In the description for this assignment I did not see anything
as far as requirements for a homepage. If I personally had more time to spend on this, my mockup would look a lot better.
