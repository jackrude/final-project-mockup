    <p>Welcome to Campus Jam!</p>
    <p>The Campus Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.

      Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by specific tastes, capabilities, and goals to find compatible musicians to contact.

      Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a profile is created that satisfies criteria that they specify.
